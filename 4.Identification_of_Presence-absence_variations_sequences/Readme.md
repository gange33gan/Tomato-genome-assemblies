# Identify PAVs
PAVs sequences between each genome and Heinz_1706 are identified through a sliding-window method. 
The sequence of PAVs consist of two parts: one is the sequences of windows that could not be aligned. The other is the sequences with length greater than or equal to 500 bp aligned to the SL4.0 genome excluding aligned sequences mapped with greater 90% identity and greater 80% coverage.
